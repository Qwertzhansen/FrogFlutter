# ðŸš¨ SECURITY NOTICE

## Important: API Keys Exposed

Your `.env` file previously contained real API keys that were committed to version control. This is a **critical security vulnerability**.

## Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Regenerate all API keys** in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Update your `.env` file** with the new keys (use `.env.example` as template)
3. **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`** to prevent future commits
4. **Review git history** and consider using tools like `git-secrets` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove sensitive data

## Best Practices:
- Never commit real API keys to version control
- Use `.env.example` files with placeholder values
- Consider using environment-specific configuration management
- Regularly rotate API keys
